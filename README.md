# Data Peek

A small and concise project that aims to provide a quick glance into a company's data
and transform raw data into relevant information.

With this small project, we can take a quick glance on how to approach a new CSV and generate
a basic, broad analysis by extracting statistical variables such as the mean, the median,
 and extrapolating our information into reliable datasets and plots with appropiate context.


## Features

- Jupyter Notebook integration for easy visualization
- Matplotplib and pandas for powerful and agile data visualization and structuring
- Fully commented  and explained code.


## Documentation

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 Excelent tool for demostrating code and visualization with other engineers.



[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) It's king for good reason. The incredibly powerful libraries
are uncomparable.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is the most popular and powerful Python module;
 used in everything right about small data sets to data warehouses. Extremely versatile and well-documented.

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) Data visualization tool. Does as required with simple, straightfoward methods.


## Ways to improve:

Incorporating PyTest would be the obvious first move, to ensure sustainability and scalability in the future.
It has been omitted because of the very narrow scope of this particular project,
but unit tests are absolutely fundamental to any scaling application.
